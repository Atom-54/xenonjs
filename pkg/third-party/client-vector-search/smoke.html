Summary of Rolling Recommendations

60 seconds or more
Moderate pressure
Moderate foam roll density
Patterned foam rolls
Vibration provides additional benefit
Foam rolling superior to roller massage devices
Muscle selection has a significant impact on benefits achieved
Self-guided, live-instructed and video-guided instruction are all effective
Active ROM (Dynamic Release) superior
Note: Research is needed comparing static Release on trigger/tender points versus rolling back and forth on a foam roll. The BI has never recommended rolling back and forth, as the original intent of foam rolling was to mimic manual ischemic compression. Dynamic Release is considered a progression of static compression with the intent of mimicking manual pin and stretch techniques.
Experienced and inexperienced lifters see similar benefits

Recommended Use:

Performance
Improves endurance performance
No effect on max strength performance
Improves power performance when followed by a active/dynamic warm-up
Recovery
Recovery from DOMS
Reduces the decrease in performance noted between frequent bouts of exercise
Not recommended between sets
Improve Movement Quality
Improves movement quality when used as part of an integrated program based on movement assessment.
